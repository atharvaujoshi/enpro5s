# Initial Concept

Zone Photo Tracker is a comprehensive industrial zone before/after photo tracking system with visual reporting, built with Next.js 14 and MongoDB Atlas. It enforces a strict photo sequence to document maintenance or work progress in specific zones, providing automated timestamps and professional reports.
